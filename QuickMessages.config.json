Essentially outdated and in some cases intentional placeholder code/systems that over time become less viable and very limiting in what certain things can be done.\n\n> As a game develops and it's feature set and systems expand, especially if big things like engine upgrades happens, it can make older things harder to sustain, as it's not up to scratch and start limiting what can be done. This causes a variety of issues as time progresses, and you start forming legacy issues.\n\n> Sometimes elements of tech debt is intentional, as it's better to do X thing instead of Y at time, as it's faster to develop and you don't need Y yet, as Z wont be ready for a long time.
